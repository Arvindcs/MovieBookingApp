Movie Booking App
---------
This movie app is written in Pure Swift. I have written this application using MVVM Architecture.
And I have also written test cases for all APIs.

Thank you

Search Functionality
---------
Case 1 - If the user searches for alphabet ‘r’, the movies that should be displayed in the list should be
1. Ralph Breaks The Internet
2. Bohemian Rhapsody
Here, Spiderman, The Grinch and Maari will not be included because the ‘r’ is in the middle of the title.

Case 2 - If the user searches for - Le Jaayenge Dilwale, the list should display the movie - Dilwale
Dulhania Le Jaayenge
You are expected to maintain a cache that contains a list of movies that the user has clicked in his
previous sessions on the search screen. This cache can have a maximum of 5 results. These will be
displayed on the Search screen under the “Recently Searched” subsection if the user hasn’t yet searched
for a movie
